# diffeq

Github repo for the code I've written for CWRU MATH 224: Ordinary Differential Equations. Forgive me not knowing Python well.

This repo is not intended as a single unified project, but is rather a playground for my exploration of numerical methods, 
and a way to show off my 1337 math skillz :)

## Dependencies
All the typical suspects, namely Matplotlib and Numpy
